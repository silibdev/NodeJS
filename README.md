# Welcome to my personal NodeJS server!

## Developing
If you want to try it locally you will need NodeJS > 6.10.0 and an instance of [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).

* Install all dependencies with `npm install`
* Run MongoDB with `mongod`
* Run `npm dev`

You will have the app running on port 8080 (if not already in use) with `nodemon`that will care of restarting the server when changes happen.
